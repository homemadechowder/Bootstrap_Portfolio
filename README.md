## About
This assignemnt is essentially revamping the same design with the new bootstrap structure. The biggest challenge like all assignments is the beginning. While I was able to quickly grasp the concept of bootstrap during class, in application I realize there is much to learn. The about page was remade by replacing the top bar with a navbars that has customized elements so it retains the same look. The content area was replaced by the grid column section which was alot easier to work with over boxes from scratch. The footer was a column-12 and easy to implement.


## Portfolio
With the navbar set up correctly, the Portfolio page was a challenge on its own, I needed to be familiar with how to work with overlapping elements in bootstrap for the pictures + labels. I was able to use my own css for custom columns so I can fit the things I want. A quick glance at a custom column is shown below:

```css
.col-custom-11{
    position: relative;
    float: left;
    font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
    font-size: 160%;
    color: #4aaaa5;
    width: 90%;
    margin-left: 50px;
    padding-top: 40px;
    padding-right: 30px;
    border-bottom: 2px solid #cccccc;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```
As shown, I took the original stylesheet of the column and remade with my own parameters.

## Contact
The contacts page once again was the easiest one to set up, as textboxes and textareas come completed from bootstrap. I copied and pasted while changing values to meet the requirements.
